# Pogmas
Pogmas is a bot used for various bits and bobs in Transport Dash (and qualifying servers).

It is quiet a basic bot. I do have plans to expand its functionality. Feel free to use the code if you want to.

## Running said bot

You can run Pogmas if you _really_ wanted to. Quite a bit of it is hardcoded though so...

1) Create a token file called **token.txt** and place the bot token there.
2) Save it to the same folder as the **Pogmas.py** file.
3) _Optional_ Change the `bot.owner_id` user ID to your user ID to have full owner functionality.
4) Run the bot!

A pm2 file is included to keep the bot online.
