# Pogmas
Pogmas is a bot used for various bits and bobs in Transport Dash (and qualifying servers).

It's a bot that's slowly growing in functionalilty as I learn more and get round to doing stuff. Feel free to use the code if you want to.

## Running said bot

You can run Pogmas if you _really_ wanted to. I wouldn't recommend it though as quite a bit of it is hardcoded and it is becoming increasingly speciallised to Transport Dash.

0) Install the following libraries:
  a) discord.py
  b) magic8ball
  c) aiosqlite
1) Create a token file called **token.txt** and place the bot token there.
2) Save it to the same folder as the **Pogmas.py** file.
3) _Optional_ Change the `bot.owner_id` user ID to your user ID to have full owner functionality.
4) Run the bot!

A pm2 file is included to keep the bot online and a blank sqlite file should be there as well.
